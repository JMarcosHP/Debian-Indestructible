# Debian-Indestructible
A Debian indestructible BTRFS installation guide based on the OpenSUSE like way, (grub-btrfs)[https://github.com/Antynea/grub-btrfs] and snapper. It handles the GRUB misconfiguration after each rollback of the system with a plugin based on (Siduction Linux)[https://siduction.org/]'s implementation.
